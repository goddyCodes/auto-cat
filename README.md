# auto-cat
üêà A moderation bot for my server (Catbot's Guild)

## Self-host
This bot is hosted on Heroku, meaning: 

‚Ä¢ It is not self-hosted.  
‚Ä¢ We will not help with self-hosting/hosting your own copy. The support server is for Catbot support only.  
‚Ä¢ You cannot use the same name or icon as our, original, version of Auto Cat.  
‚Ä¢ We won't stop you trying to self-host, feel free to, but we won't help you if you need help or mess up.  

With this being said, you're free to self-host this if you know what you're doing but we won't provide support for this specific area.
